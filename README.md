# Module-21-Challenge
#  OVERVIEW
The purpose of this challenge was to identify the meaninful values in the dataset such as we can see in the graphs and then with that consideations of application and classification make the model.
#  RESULTS
##  Data Preprocessing
  ### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
  In the binary classification it was the "IS SUCCESFUL", in a multi class the APPLICATION and CLASSIFICATION
  ### What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  They are the categorical values ['APPLICATION_TYPE','AFFILIATION','CLASSIFICATION','USE_CASE','ORGANIZATION','INCOME_AMT','SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS']
  ### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
  The object columns, such as T3, T4
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
